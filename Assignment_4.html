<h1>Assignment 4 Instructions</h1>

Congrats on the work you have done so far :) <br>
Welcome to assignment 4.<br>
Here we are testing how well we do on paper design before we embark on our projects.<br>
You are welcome to be as creative as you want , if you want you can even choose to develop games , <br>
I encourage you to digitize some of your favorite African  games from  when  you were younger. <br><br>

Think about what you would like to do for the final project this term.<br>
Do the proper class design of every object that you are going to have .<br>
Write pseudo code for every method that you are going to have .<br>
Submit five test cases for each object<br>
Submit as a PDF<br>
Read up about overriding<br>

<h3>Grading Rubric</h3>
This assignment is graded on 100%<br>
Having the right design is 50 % , here I mean all the classes that you are going to need ,
their right attributes and right methods<br>
Having the right test cases 30%<br>
For the test cases you will submit them in a form of a table <br>

 <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Number</th>
        <th>Test case description</th>
        <th>Test data</th>
          <th>Expected result</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>eg. 1</td>
        <td> </td>
        <td> </td>
          <td> </td>
      </tr>
 </table>

<br>Pseudo code for every method is worth 20 %<br><br>
